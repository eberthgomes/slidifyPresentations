## Body Mass Index

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.

Devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing "social physics",[2] it is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height â€“ with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.

$$ BMI = \frac{mass(kg)}{(height(m))^{2}}$$

The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.
